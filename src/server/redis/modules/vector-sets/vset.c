 * ======================== Understand threading model =========================
 * This code implements threaded operarations for two of the commands:
 *
 * 1. VSIM, by default.
 * 2. VADD, if the CAS option is specified.
 *
 * Note that even if the second operation, VADD, is a write operation, only
 * the neighbors collection for the new node is performed in a thread: then,
 * the actual insert is performed in the reply callback VADD_CASReply(),
 * which is executed in the main thread.
 *
 * Threaded operations need us to protect various operations with mutexes,
 * even if a certain degree of protection is already provided by the HNSW
 * library. Here are a few very important things about this implementation
 * and the way locking is performed.
 *
 * 1. All the write operations are performed in the main Redis thread:
 *    this also include VADD_CASReply() callback, that is called by Redis
 *    internals only in the context of the main thread. However the HNSW
 *    library allows background threads in hnsw_search() (VSIM) to modify
 *    nodes metadata to speedup search (to understand if a node was already
 *    visited), but this only happens after acquiring a specific lock
 *    for a given "read slot".
 *
 * 2. We use a global lock for each Vector Set object, called "in_use". This
 *    lock is a read-write lock, and is acquired in read mode by all the
 *    threads that perform reads in the background. It is only acquired in
 *    write mode by vectorSetWaitAllBackgroundClients(): the function acquires
 *    the lock and immediately releases it, with the effect of waiting all the
 *    background threads still running from ending their execution.
 *
 *    Note that no thread can be spawned, since we only call
 *    vectorSetWaitAllBackgroundClients() from the main Redis thread, that
 *    is also the only thread spawning other threads.
 *
 *    vectorSetWaitAllBackgroundClients() is used in two ways:
 *    A) When we need to delete a vector set because of (DEL) or other
 *       operations destroying the object, we need to wait that all the
 *       background threads working with this object finished their work.
 *    B) When we modify the HNSW nodes bypassing the normal locking
 *       provided by the HNSW library. This only happens when we update
 *       an existing node attribute so far, in VSETATTR and when we call
 *       VADD to update a node with the SETATTR option.
 *
 *  3. Often during read operations performed by Redis commands in the
 *     main thread (VCARD, VEMB, VRANDMEMBER, ...) we don't acquire any
 *     lock at all. The commands run in the main Redis thread, we can only
 *     have, at the same time, background reads against the same data
 *     structure. Note that VSIM_thread() and VADD_thread() still modify the
 *     read slot metadata, that is node->visited_epoch[slot], but as long as
 *     our read commands running in the main thread don't need to use
 *     hnsw_search() or other HNSW functions using the visited epochs slots
 *     we are safe.
 *
 * 4. There is a race from the moment we create a thread, passing the
 *    vector set object, to the moment the thread can actually lock the
 *    result win the in_use_lock mutex: as the thread starts, in the meanwhile
 *    a DEL/expire could trigger and remove the object. For this reason
 *    we use an atomic counter that protects our object for this small
 *    time in vectorSetWaitAllBackgroundClients(). This prevents removal
 *    of objects that are about to be taken by threads.
 *
 *    Note that other competing solutions could be used to fix the problem
 *    but have their set of issues, however they are worth documenting here
 *    and evaluating in the future:
 *
 *      A. Using a conditional variable we could "wait" for the thread to
 *         acquire the lock. However this means waiting before returning
 *         to the event loop, and would make the command execution slower.
 *      B. We could use again an atomic variable, like we did, but this time
 *         as a refcount for the object, with a vsetAcquire() vsetRelease().
 *         In this case, the command could retain the object in the main thread
 *         before starting the thread, and the thread, after the work is done,
 *         could release it. This way sometimes the object would be freed by
 *         the thread, and it's while now can be safe to do the kind of resource
 *         deallocation that vectorSetReleaseObject() does, given that the
 *         Redis Modules API is not always thread safe this solution may not
 *         be future-proof. However there is to evaluate it better in the
 *         future.
 *      C. We could use the "B" solution but instead of freeing the object
 *         in the thread, in this specific case we could just put it into a
 *         list and defer it for later freeing (for instance in the reply
 *         callback), so that the object is always freed in the main thread.
 *         This would require a list of objects to free.
 *
 *    However the current solution only disadvantage is the potential busy
 *    loop, but this busy loop in practical terms will almost never do
 *    much: to trigger it, a number of circumnstances must happen: deleting
 *    Vector Set keys while using them, hitting the small window needed to
 *    start the thread and read-lock the mutex.
